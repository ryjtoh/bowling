# Two Swings!
As the name implies, this project is related to golf as a connection to a learning experience with the slope formula. The website provides basic information about y = mx + b, and below it contains an interactive game that helps users learn how change the slope and the y-intercept changes a linear line. The goal of the game is to make two hole in one's by lining up a linear line to the two holes, which are fit to a line. The changes are made through two sliders for changing the slope and y-intercept, and the changes are displayed in real time in both equation form and graphically. This HTML5 based website also includes sound files that are invoked upon certain actions.

This website is built on basic HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and Canvas.
